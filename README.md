## Technologies run-down

- Nuxt 3 (v4 ready!)
- Tauri 2
- NuxtUI v3
- TailwindCSS v4
- Typescript
- ESLint
- Auto imports (for Tauri api too!)

## Functionalities

- Run shell commands from the app
- Send custom notifications to the client (remember to turn on/grant notifications in your computer settings)
- Display OS related informations
- Store and retrieve data locally
- Show tray icon
- Support all Nuxt functionalities (routing/layout/middleware/modules/etc...)

## Setup

  - Before running this app, you need to configure your environment with Rust. Take a look at the [Tauri docs](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites).
  - This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as its package manager. Make sure you have it installed on your system.
  - The frontend runs on the usual port `3000` of Nuxt, the Tauri server uses the port `3001`. This settings are customizable in the `nuxt.config.ts` and `tauri.conf.json`.
  - Once ready, follow these commands:

  ```sh
  # use this template
  $ npx degit NicolaSpadari/nuxtor my-nuxtor-app

  # go into the folder
  $ cd my-nuxtor-app

  # install dependencies
  $ bun install

  # start the project
  $ bun run tauri:dev
  ```

  This will run the Nuxt frontend and will launch the Tauri window.

## Build

  ```sh
  $ bun run tauri:build
  ```

This command will generate the Nuxt static output and bundle the project under `src-tauri/target`.

## Debug

  ```sh
  $ bun run tauri:build:debug
  ```

The same Tauri bundle will generate under `src-tauri/target`, but with the ability to open the console.

## Notes

- Tauri v2 brings some big refactors, such as packages names and permission management. New permissions have to be granted under `src-tauri/capabilities/main.json`
- Tauri functions are auto imported with the help of a custom module, named like `useTauri<LibraryName>`. If another Tauri plugin is added, then the module has to be updated to support its functions under `app/modules/tauri.ts`
- As per documentation, Nuxt SSR must be disabled in order for Tauri to act as the backend. Still, all Nuxt goodies will be functional.
- NuxtUI is a very powerful UI library that consolidates design over the entire application. While there is a more complete pro version, it requires a license. It's up to you to buy the pro version, or stick with the free version.
